# Minty Calculator

This is a simple calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The goal of this project was to take a calculator made with jQuery, and recreate it using Vanilla JS.  

Minty color is derived from pure Hexadecimal extract.  No plants were harmed in the making of Minty Calculator.
